Dated 18 May 2020: I have already seen certain part of the the vido and read few topics from Learning Python by Mark Lutz

I have started reading Learning Python by Mark Lutz. The reading is not in a particular order. 
I understood the need for practice and Found Mosh's Python video on FreeCodeCamp Youtube channel. 
Idea is to practice as and when the practice exercise on the video is given.
Hope to do some Python coding on my own by the end of this.
